## Overview
### Description
Users are able to find ingredients for certain recipes in nearby stores and optimize for certain criteria, ie price, "healthiness", etc.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Utility, food
- **Mobile:** Yes
- **Story:** Users are able to find ingredients for certain recipes in nearby stores and optimize for certain criteria, ie price, “healthiness”, etc. Show totals for ingredients at different stores, shortest path between stores? 
- **Market:** Anyone who cooks, perhaps people who like to share what they cook?
- **Habit:** Users may be able to share with others what they've made and where they got their ingredients
- **Scope:** 
    - V1 would have a basic set of recipes and show where ingredients are at different stores on a map. 
    - V2 would have the prices of everything at each store and some heuristic for "healthiness" of ingredients and recipes, and display a sorted list of stores to buy ingredients with those metrics in mind. 
    - V3 might have some feature to share with others what meals you've made and the details about it.

* User posts recipe they made and can see recipes their friends made, pictures and other details
